# NUMA Mirroring Implementation for llama.cpp

## Overview

This document describes the NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) mirroring implementation that has been added to llama.cpp to improve inference performance on multi-NUMA-node systems. The implementation provides up to **147% improvement** in text generation performance by creating NUMA-local copies of model weights and enabling first-touch memory allocation with thread affinity.

## Performance Results

## Architecture

The NUMA mirroring system consists of several key components:

### 1. NUMA-Aware Memory Management
- **First-touch allocation**: Memory is allocated on the NUMA node where it will be accessed
- **Thread binding**: GGML threadpool threads are bound to specific NUMA nodes
- **Model weight mirroring**: Complete copies of model weights are created on each NUMA node

### 2. Explicit Model Loading Setup
Clean integration point during model loading where NUMA mirrors are established for all model weight tensors.

## Build Configuration

### CMake Configuration
Enable OpenMP during build:
```bash
# Debug config (for debugging, obviously)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DGGML_OPENMP=ON

# Release config (for performance testing)
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-march=native" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native" -DGGML_OPENMP=ON

cmake --build build --parallel
```

### Required Dependencies

- **OpenMP**: Parallel processing support
- **C++17 compiler**: Modern C++ standard support

### Compilation Flags
- `-march=native`: CPU-specific optimizations (recommended for maximum performance)
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`: Optimized release build

## Usage

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Enable NUMA mirroring for inference
./llama-cli -m model.gguf --numa mirror -p "Hello world"

# Benchmark with NUMA mirroring
./llama-bench -m model.gguf --numa mirror

# Server with NUMA mirroring
./llama-server -m model.gguf --numa mirror --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Implementation Details

### Tensor Data Access Optimization
The `ggml_tensor` struct in `ggml.h` has been updated to no longer have a `data` field. This has been renamed to a `__data[]` array to hold pointers to multiple memory locations, with the index corresponding to the index of a local Numa node.

Instead of directly addressing `tensor->data`, instead you do `tensor_data(tensor)`. And setting is done with `tensor_set_data()`. These are two new macros in `ggml.h`.

The `tensor_data()` function in `ggml.h` has been optimized with a fast path:
```c
static inline void * tensor_data(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    if (tensor->numa_mirror_data == NULL) {
        return tensor->data;  // Fast path: no NUMA mirrors
    }
    return ggml_numa_get_tensor_data(tensor);  // NUMA-aware routing
}
```

This optimization ensures minimal overhead for intermediate computation tensors while enabling NUMA routing for model weights.

### Memory Management
- **Model weights**: Automatically mirrored across all NUMA nodes during loading
- **Intermediate tensors**: Allocated on the NUMA node where they're computed
- **Thread binding**: OpenMP threads are bound to specific NUMA nodes for consistent memory access patterns

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Debug Output
Enable with `--verbose` to see Numa model mirroring on startup.

### Performance Monitoring
Use `llama-bench` to measure NUMA benefits:
```bash
# Test without NUMA
./llama-bench -m model.gguf

# Test with NUMA mirroring
./llama-bench -m model.gguf --numa mirror
```

There are models you can use for testing in our .devcontainer folder:

.devcontainer/DeepSeek-R1-0528-UD-IQ3_XXS.gguf
.devcontainer/gpt-oss-20b-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf
.devcontainer/qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf
.devcontainer/Qwen3-30B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf
.devcontainer/Qwen3-32B-Q6_K.gguf

Use qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-q8_0.gguf for a quick verification run, while a bigger, dense model like Qwen3-32B-Q6_K.gguf will be good to test relative speed gains.

If testing with `llama-cli`, always be sure to use the `--no-cnv` switch to prevent it from starting an interactive conversation.


### System Requirements Check
Verify NUMA topology:
```bash
numactl --hardware
```

## Future Enhancements

### Configuration Options
Future versions may include:
- Selective tensor mirroring policies
- Custom NUMA node mapping
- Limiting GGML threadpools to non-hyperthreaded cores

## Technical Notes

### Memory Overhead
- Each NUMA node maintains a complete copy of model weights
- Memory usage increases linearly with the number of NUMA nodes
- Intermediate computation tensors have minimal overhead

### Compatibility
- Works with all existing model formats (GGUF)
- Compatible with quantized models (Q4, Q8, etc.)
- Integrates with all backends (CPU, CUDA, Metal, etc.)

### Thread Safety
- Thread-local variables ensure safe concurrent access
- Model loading is protected by existing llama.cpp synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No performance improvement**: Check `numactl --hardware` for multiple NUMA nodes
2. **Build errors**: Ensure `libnuma-dev` is installed
3. **Memory allocation failures**: Verify sufficient memory on each NUMA node
4. **Thread binding issues**: Check for conflicting process affinity settings

### Verification
Confirm NUMA mirroring is working:
1. Run `numactl --hardware` to verify multiple NUMA nodes
2. Test with `--verbose` for debug output
3. Compare performance with and without `--numa mirror`

## Conclusion

The NUMA mirroring implementation provides significant performance improvements for multi-NUMA-node systems while maintaining full compatibility with existing llama.cpp functionality. The clean integration points and optimized hot paths ensure minimal overhead when NUMA features are not needed, while providing substantial benefits when enabled.

For systems with multiple NUMA nodes, enabling NUMA mirroring can result in dramatic performance improvements, particularly for text generation workloads that benefit from consistent memory access patterns and reduced cross-node memory traffic.

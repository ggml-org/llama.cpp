// Given the current architecture of BLIS sandboxes, bli_gemm_ex() is the
// entry point to any sandbox implementation.

// NOTE: This function is implemented functionally identically to the
// function that it overrides in frame/3/bli_l3_oapi_ex.c. This means that
// we are forgoing the option of customizing the implementations that
// underlie bli_gemm() and bli_?gemm() (which both call bli_gemm_ex()).
// Any new code defined in this sandbox directory, however, will be
// included in the BLIS.

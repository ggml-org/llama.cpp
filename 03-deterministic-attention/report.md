Perfect. I’ll now put together a comprehensive roadmap for achieving full deterministic inference in llama.cpp using the CUDA backend.

This final report will:

* Integrate deterministic RMSNorm, MatMul, and Attention (Flash Attention or standard) with fixed tile sizes and stable reduction order.
* Ensure deterministic, position-invariant KV-cache layout regardless of prompt length.
* Maintain output determinism across restarts, including reproducibility for the same prompt.
* Use compile-time flag `LLAMA_DETERMINISTIC` to enable this mode.
* Include exact file paths, key line numbers, modular implementation phases, and test-driven validation strategies.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the full implementation blueprint.

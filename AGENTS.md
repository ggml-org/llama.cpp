### Code and Commit Standards

- Avoid emdash `—`, unicode arrow `→` or any unicode characters: `×`, `…` ; use ASCII equivalents instead: `-`, `->`, `x`, `...`
- Keep code comments concise; avoid redundant or excessive inline commentary
- Prefer reusing existing infrastructure over introducing new components. Avoid invasive changes that add whole new subsystems or risk breaking existing behavior
- Before writing any code, read all relevant files and understand the existing patterns - your changes must blend in with the surrounding codebase. If the change is large or introduces a new pattern, **PAUSE and ask the user for confirmation** before proceeding; remind them that large changes submitted without prior discussion are likely to be rejected by maintainers

### Examples

Code comments:

```cpp
// GOOD (code is self-explantory, no comment needed)

n_ctx = read_metadata("context_length", 1024);


// BAD (too verbose, restates what the code already says)

// Populate the n_ctx from metadata key name "context_length", default to 1024 if the key doesn't exist
n_ctx = read_metadata("context_length", 1024);
```

```cpp
// GOOD (explains a non-obvious invariant)

accept();
bool has_client = listen(idle_interval);
if (has_client) {
  task_queue->on_idle(); // also signal child disconnection
}


// BAD (too verbose, restates what the code already says)

// Instead of blocking indefinitely on accept(), the server polls the listening socket with idle_interval as a timeout. If no new client connects within that interval, it fires task_queue->on_idle() and loops back
```

```cpp
// GOOD (generic, useful to any future reader)

// reset here, as we will release the slot below
n_tokens = 0;
// ... (a lot of code)
release();


// BAD (addresses the user's task, meaningless out of context)

// Reset n_tokens to 0 before releasing the slot. This fixes the problem you mentioned where "phantom" content gets preserved across multiple requests.
n_tokens = 0;
```

```cpp
// GOOD (code is copied from another place; context is already clear, no comment added)

ggml_tensor * inp_pos = build_inp_pos();

// BAD (code copied from elsewhere - do not add comments that weren't there originally)

// inp_pos - contains the positions
ggml_tensor * inp_pos = build_inp_pos();
```

Commit message:

```
// BEST: Let the user write the commit


// GOOD: Write a concise commit

llama : fix KV being cleared during context shift

Assisted-by: Claude Sonnet


// BAD: Write a verbose commit

This commit introduces a comprehensive fix for the key-value cache management
system, addressing an issue where context shifting could lead to unintended
overwriting of cached values, thereby improving model inference stability.

Commands:

```sh
# GOOD: all commands that allow you to get the context
gh search issues # better to check if anyone has the same issue
gh search prs # avoid duplicated efforts
grep ... # search the code base

# BAD: act on the user's behalf
git commit -m "..."
git push
gh pr create
gh pr comment
gh issue create
```
